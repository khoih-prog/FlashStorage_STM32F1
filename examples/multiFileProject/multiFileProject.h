  For STM32F1 using Flash emulated-EEPROM

  The FlashStorage_STM32F1 library aims to provide a convenient way to store and retrieve user's data using the non-volatile flash memory
  of STM32F1. It now supports writing and reading the whole object, not just byte-and-byte.

  Based on and modified from Cristian Maglie's FlashStorage (https://github.com/cmaglie/FlashStorage)
